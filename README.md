# Face Detection

This is a simple _python_ script which detects human faces from digital images, videos and live webcam using **OpenCV**.<br /> OpenCV is the most popular library for computer vision. Originally written in C/C++, it now provides bindings for Python.
<br />

## What is Face Detection?
**Face Detection** is the method of discovering all possible faces at different locations with different sizes in a given image. It is an important **first step** to many **advanced** computer vision, biometrics recognition and multimedia applications, such as _face tracking_, _face recognition_, and _video surveillance_.

## Steps To Execute
Before executing the `main.py` file, make sure to install the necessary modules & libraries.
-    `pip install numpy`
-    `pip install opencv-python`
-    `pip install opencv-contrib-python` <br />

## The `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` File
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. ***OpenCV*** already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc..
Download the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file (Given Here) and save it in the same working location in which `main.py` is located.
